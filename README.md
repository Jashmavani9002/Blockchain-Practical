# Blockchain-Practical

Practical 1: To implement digital signature to sign and verify authenticated user. Also, show a message when tampering is detected.ile.

Practical 2:To create a blockchain and implement replay attacks on blockchain.

Create a formal document showing the implementation steps and learning outcomes for the second practical.

Practical 3: To perform thorough study and installation of Anaconda 5 0 1 and Python 3 6 and perform proof of work ( consensus mechanism Also, notice the changes in mining rewards and nonce requirement

Practical 4: Byzantine Fault Tolerance

Practical 6: Voting System
To build, implement and test voting mechanism using Ethereum Blockchain. First, list the contestants on the screen and the vote they got. Whenever the user tries to vote a particular contestant, the count of the votes for the particular contestant should increase by 1. Also, the user who has already voted should be marked. Marked means “the user has already voted once and will not be allowed to vote again”.


Practical 7: Hyperledger Fabric
To perform a thorough study of blockchain development on Hyperledger Fabric using Composer

Practical 8. DApps
To design and develop end-to-end decentralized applications (Dapps).

Practical 9. Creating a smart contract
To write a Solidity contract that implements a distributed ticket sales system. Anybody can create an event (specifying the initial price and number of tickets). Anybody can then purchase one of the initial tickets or sell those tickets peer-topeer. At the event, gate agents will check that each attendee is listed in the final attendees list on the blockchain. (Ethereum programming).

Practical 10: Implementing Tic-Tac-Toe game
To write a contract code to implement a two‐player game Tic‐Tac‐Toe
